	<li><a href="https://github.com/LaurelOak/hydro-teaching-resources/blob/master/Assignment2MonoLake.ipynb" target="_blank">Water balance models in Python: Mono Lake Case study, continued</a>: Students convert the spreadsheet-based Mono Lake model into a simple program in Python.</li>
	<li><a href="https:https://github.com/LaurelOak/hydro-teaching-resources/blob/master/Assignment3ClausiusClapeyron.ipynb" target="_blank">Extreme rainfall, climate change, and evapotranspiration</a>: In the first part of the assignment, students use the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship to quantify expected increases in rainfall with increased temperature. In the second part of this assignment, students work with a model of how evaporation influences mosquito habitat. This part of the assignment requires files from our partners at the <a href="http://www.idmod.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Disease Modeling</a>, which must be <a href="mailto:laurel@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">requested</a> formally.</li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IvyW8vqE-KY4JS3zNISvxQtGN6cEesYO3j3pDMFOAo8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Hydrologic mapping: watersheds and spatial interpolation:</a> Students delineate (by hand) nested watersheds from a topographic map. They then use Jupyter Notebooks (see file <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LaurelOak/hydro-teaching-resources/blob/master/Assignment4HydrologicMapping.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>) to spatially interpolate data from multiple rain gages and generate hyetograms from the watershed.</li>
	<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzoZUD3hISA4SF9Ea1A0bmZjeEU/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Strawberry Creek discharge assignment</a>: Students use floats, dye, an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, and salt dilution gauging as alternative methods to calculate the discharge of Strawberry Creek, which runs through the campus of UC Berkeley. Students also learn to read a staff gauge. See Strawberry Creek data and photos <a href="http://creeks.berkeley.edu/node/14" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/LaurelOak/hydro-teaching-resources/blob/master/Assignment6StreamflowOrovilleDam.ipynb" target="_blank">How rare was the flood that broke the Oroville Dam spillway?</a> Students use a dataset from the Feather River just below the Oroville Dam to compute the frequency of the flow event that breached the dam's spillway in 2017. In part II of the assignment, students interpret a Python model of how streamflow influences mosquito habitat. This part of the assignment requires files from our partners at the <a href="http://www.idmod.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Disease Modeling</a>, which must be <a href="mailto:laurel@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">requested</a> formally.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/LaurelOak/hydro-teaching-resources/blob/master/Assignment7Groundwater.ipynb" target="_blank">Groundwater and the Woburn Toxics Trial</a>: Students act as investigative hydrogeologists in modeling potential contamination plumes using data from the Superfund case behind the book and movie <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Civil Action</span>. They are introduced to spatial modeling in Python and deepen their expertise in performing regression analysis and using functions. They also gain experience in working with the Cooper-Jacob equation and Theim equation. This exercise is based on a similar spreadsheet-based exercise found <a href="http://serc.carleton.edu/woburn/student-modules/flow/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

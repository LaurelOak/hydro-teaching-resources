    "    jupyter notebook\n",

You can also navigate around the files on your computer to find a file you wish to edit by clicking the \"Upload\" button in the upper right corner.  You can also click \"New\" in the upper right corner to get a new Jupyter notebook.  After selecting the file you wish to edit, it will appear in a new window in your browser, beautifully formatted and ready to edit."

    "\n",
    "A code cell contains actual code that you want to run.  You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar in your Jupyter notebook.  Otherwise, you can can hit `esc` and then `y` (denoted \"`esc, y`\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell.  Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit \"`shift + enter`.\"  Note that code cells are executed in the order you execute them.  That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit \"`shift + enter`\" is the order in which the code is executed.  If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are not known to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells contain text.  The text is written in **markdown**, a lightweight markup language.  You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  Note that you can also insert HTML or $\\LaTeX$ expressions into markdown cells, and they will be rendered properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text.  Hitting \"`shift + enter`\" renders the text in the formatting you specify. You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting \"`esc, m`\" in the cell.  Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode (or you can just double-click on the cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can use the \"Insert\" pulldown menu from the Jupyter toolbar.  The shortcut to insert a cell below is \"`esc, b`\" and to insert a cell above is \"`esc, a`.\"  Alternatively, you  can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting \"`alt + enter`.\""

When you define a function, you should make sure it is properly commented with descriptive doc strings.

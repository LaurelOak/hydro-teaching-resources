    "## Background\n",
    "This investigation of groundwater flow and drawdown in wells is based on the lawsuit described in the book and movie A Civil Action (a true story). For the background behind this story, read [the Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Civil_Action). Then look at the map and animation of the study site [here](http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/woburnpics.htm). Wells G and H shown on the map are the municipal wells from which Woburn’s water supply was withdrawn. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will be investigating some of the very problems that the hydrologists hired to the case worked on. As usual, you may work with another person, but each person must turn in separate assignments and specify whom they worked with. Below I provide additional information specific to this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "One of the important questions raised during the trial centered on the drawdown of the water table when wells G and H (see map linked above) were operating and the effects of the Riley tannery well (also included in the model). If, when wells G and/or H operated, the water table was drawn down on the east side of the Aberjona River, then contaminants from west side of the river valley (Beatrice 15 acres and Olympia Trucking) could flow under the river to wells G and H. If the water table was not drawn down on the east side of the river when wells G, H, and the Riley Tannery well operated, then it is unlikely that contaminants on the west side of the river valley could flow to wells G and H. Thus, the interaction of these three wells with the Aberjona River and the groundwater flow system was critical to determining which of the contaminated properties contributed TCE and PCE to wells G and H.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating sources of impact to wells G and H\n",
    "Proving the connection between the contaminants migrating from the defendants’ properties to wells G and H during the first phase of the trial was a requirement to proceed to the next phase. To make arguments regarding the potential sources of TCE to wells G and H, the plaintiffs' expert had to define the subsurface geology, the surface and subsurface, and show that TCE was used at both the Riley/Beatrice and W.R. Grace properties. Counsel for the plaintiffs was able to identify Grace employees involved with on-site TCE disposal activities. However, the plaintiffs' counsel was not able to directly link disposal of wastes on the Riley 15-acre property with activities at the tannery itself. The [ATSDR report](http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/PHA/wellsgh/wgh_p1.html), which was prepared three years after the trial, is a good illustration of how difficult it is to conclusively assess risk from a specific contaminant source at the Woburn site.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding groundwater flow to wells\n",
    "The U.S. Geological Survey first performed a seven-hour pumping test to characterize aquifer properties, and then, in December 1985-January 1986, a 30-day pumping test to evaluate the effects of pumping on the distribution of hydraulic head. This was the first time wells G and H operated since their closure in May 1979. It was also the first time synoptic sets of water levels had ever been measured in the network of monitoring wells surrounding wells G and H. During the 30-day pumping test, wells G and H operated at their average rates of 700 gpm (well G) and 400 gpm (well H). However, pumping records kept by the City of Woburn showed that between 1964 and 1979 the wells rarely operated together and that the two municipal wells were frequently not in use for months at a time. As a result of changes in the pumping rates of wells G and H and their periodic (discontinuous) use, the water table in the buried valley aquifer was dynamic, rising and falling as wells G and H were turned on and off and pumped heavily or lightly. These dynamic changes in water levels result in the groundwater flow system being transient in character – as opposed to being steady state in character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under steady-state conditions, water levels at any location in the flow system do not change with time, which results in hydraulic gradients and flow velocities at any location not changing with time, and therein no net change in the amount of groundwater in storage. Under transient conditions, water levels at any location in the flow system change with time, which causes hydraulic gradients, flow velocities, and the amount of groundwater in storage (water levels) to change with time. In this exercise we assume that the wells G and H have been pumping together for a long enough time that the water table is stationary and flow is steady state. This is an assumption that we recognize is not true over periods of time greater than a few months. This simplistic assumption lets us learn about drawdown created by a single pumping well, the formation of a cone of depression, superposition of drawdowns from one or more pumping wells, and the creation of groundwater divides between pumping wells, all of which are important to understanding the responses of the groundwater flow system to the pumping history of wells G and H. \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of the Riley well was estimated by de Lima and Olimpio ([USGS, 1989](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/1989/4059/report.pdf)) to operate at an average pumping rate of 200 gallons per minute, continuously. This was based on the wastewater discharge emanating from the tannery; actual pumping rates were not available. It is believed that pumping volumes fluctuated depending on the number of shifts working, the volume of leather orders, actual type of leather being processed, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I of assignment: Solving for aquifer properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe hydrologists who worked on the Woburn case conducted a pumping test in well H to determine the aquifer’s properties (storativity and hydraulic conductivity). Although I couldn’t access their data, I generated synthetic data that will give you the same results, in the cell below. During the pumping test, well H was pumped at a rate of 475 gallons per minute. Drawdown was measured in an observation well 75 feet away from the pumping well. The thickness of the aquifer was measured to be 140 ft. Using the Cooper-Jacob equation and the regression method we discussed in class, determine the aquifer’s hydraulic conductivity (in feet per day) and storativity. In your answer, show the plot of your regression (don't forget to label the axes, or to take the log of time), and mathematically show how you arrived at your final answer. Make sure to keep track of your units! *[1 pt.]*\n",

    "With knowledge of the hydraulic conductivity, you can now solve the Thiem equation for the equilibrium potentiometric surface under different combinations of well pumping rates.

Assume that the Riley well (QR) pumps at an average rate of 200 gallons per minute (gpm), Well G (QG) pumps at an average rate of 700 gpm, and Well H (QH) pumps at an average rate of 400 gpm. When you run the module, you will see two plots. The first plot is a filled contour plot that depicts the drawdown relative to non-pumping conditions. The value shown is the composite amount of drawdown related to pumping from each well (drawdowns are additive). Note how the values increase in the cells immediately around the wells and decrease toward the margins of the graph. \n",
